JOINs are automatic, and disambiguated by the the reference path `Athelete.team.name`
## Types
https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3-types

These are the only built in type mappings

| Python | SQLite  |
|--------|---------|
| None   | NULL    |
| int    | INTEGER |
| float  | REAL    |
| str    | TEXT    |
| bytes  | BLOB    |

We also include by default the following mappings

| Python   | SQLite            | Adapt/Convert      |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------|
| bool     | builtins.bool     | 1 -> x01, 0 -> x00 |
| list     | builtins.list     | json dumps/loads   |
| dict     | builtins.dict     | json dumps/loads   |
| date     | datetime.date     | .isoformat()       |
| datetime | datetime.datetime | .isoformat()       |

Any other types will attempt to be pickled.


If you want to customize how you serialize, we use a thin wrapper on top of Adapt/Convert api.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3-adapter-converter-recipes

    def adapt_date_iso(val):
        """Adapt datetime.date to ISO 8601 date."""
        return val.isoformat()

    sqlite3.register_adapter(datetime.date, adapt_date_iso)


    def convert_date(val):
        """Convert ISO 8601 date to datetime.date object."""
        return datetime.date.fromisoformat(val.decode())

    sqlite3.register_converter("date", convert_date)

So our api which wraps the above would look like this:

    def adapt_datetime_iso(val: datetime.datetime) -> bytes:
        """Adapt datetime.datetime to ISO 8601 date and time."""
        return val.isoformat().encode()

    def convert_datetime_iso(data: bytes) -> datetime.datetime:
        """Convert ISO 8601 date and time to datetime.datetime object."""
        return dt.datetime.fromisoformat(data.decode())

    from micro_namedtuple_sqlite_persister import register_adapt_convert

    register_adapt_convert(datetime.datetime, adapt_datetime_iso, convert_datetime_iso)

### A note on JSON columns
Currently we do not apply adapters/converters to json dumps, because without specifying a schema there is no way to reliably recover type info.

Even something as simple as date, would be ambiguous, because it could be a date or str going in

    {"date": "2021-01-01"}

If we enable dt.datetime serialization, then the above could have been

    dict(date=dt.datetime(2021, 1, 1))

or

    dict(date="2021-01-01")

## Notes from RoR Active Record
### Connection Handling
Implicit Connection Handling: Active Record uses a global connection pool and thread-local connections instead of an explicitly passed session object. On the first database call in a given thread (e.g. a web request thread), Active Record will check out a connection from the pool and associate it with that thread
discuss.rubyonrails.org . That same connection is reused for all queries in the thread by default, instead of checking out/in on every query, to reduce lock overhead discuss.rubyonrails.org . Rails keeps track of the “current” connection via a thread-local key, ensuring each thread uses its own database connection .

Request Lifecycle and Cleanup: In a typical Rails request, the framework ensures the connection is returned to the pool at the end. The Rack middleware

Transactions and Context: Active Record provides methods like Model.transaction do ... end to run a block of code in a database transaction. Internally, this just uses the thread’s connection to BEGIN/COMMIT

### No Identity Map
Identity Map (or Lack Thereof): One notable aspect of Active Record’s implicit approach is that it historically does not implement a global identity map by default (unlike explicit session ORMs which typically do). In other words, if you query the same record twice in Rails (outside of the same short-lived transaction or object reference), you’ll get two separate Ruby object instances representing the same row. Rails did experiment with an optional Identity Map in Rails 3.2 (to ensure each object is loaded only once per request/thread)
api.rubyonrails.org
api.rubyonrails.org
, but it was disabled by default and later removed. Without an explicit session tracking all loaded entities, Rails forgoes the complexity of a long-lived identity map. This means less memory overhead and bookkeeping, at the cost of potential duplicate objects

### No engine or session
These are injected into the objects themselves at runtime. AR assumes DB schema is source of truth.
Migrations are done in a DSL with an external

### recursive saves are configured per attribute/field

### ruby autocompletions for fields are not native and come in via rbi files (like pyi files)
### relationships defined with `has_many`, `belongs_to`, `has_one`, `has_and_belongs_to_many`,
